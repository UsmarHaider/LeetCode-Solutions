# Intuition
The problem seems to ask for removing duplicates from a sorted array and returning the length of the modified array. My first thought is to iterate through the array and keep track of unique elements, then overwrite the original array with these unique elements.

# Approach
I'll initialize an empty list to store unique elements. Then, I'll iterate through the given array, and whenever I encounter a new element, I'll append it to the temporary list. Finally, I'll overwrite the original array with these unique elements.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the input array. The space used is proportional to the number of unique elements in the array.

# Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        temp = []
        temp.append(nums[0])
        i = 1
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
                temp.append(nums[i])
            i += 1

        for i in range(len(temp)):
            nums[i] = temp[i]

        return len(temp)
```
