# Intuition
The task here seems to involve removing all instances of a specified value from an array and returning the length of the modified array. One approach could be to iterate through the array, keeping only the elements that are not equal to the given value.

# Approach
I'll initialize an empty list to store non-matching elements. Then, I'll iterate through the given array. For each element that is not equal to the specified value, I'll append it to the temporary list. Finally, I'll overwrite the original array with these non-matching elements.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where \(n\) is the length of the input array. The space used is proportional to the number of non-matching elements in the array.

# Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        temp = []

        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != val:
                temp.append(nums[j])

        for i in range(len(temp)):
            nums[i] = temp[i]

        return len(temp)
```
