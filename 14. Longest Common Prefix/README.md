# Intuition
To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings, one intuitive approach is to compare characters at the same position across all strings. If they all match, the character can be added to the prefix. If there's a mismatch, we stop and return the prefix formed so far.

# Approach
1. Start by handling edge cases. If the input list is empty, return an empty string.
2. Find the length of the shortest string in the list, as the common prefix cannot be longer than this length.
3. Iterate over the characters at each position up to the minimum length found.
4. For each position, compare the character at that position in the first string with the corresponding characters in the rest of the strings.
5. If all characters match, append the character to the prefix.
6. If there's a mismatch, return the prefix formed so far.
7. Finally, return the prefix.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where \( n \) is the number of strings and \( m \) is the length of the shortest string. We iterate over all strings and compare characters up to the length of the shortest string.
- Space complexity: $$O(m)$$, where \( m \) is the length of the shortest string. The space is used to store the prefix string.

# Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """

        if not strs:
            return ""

        min_length = min(len(s) for s in strs)
        prefix = ""

        for i in range(min_length):
            first_character = strs[0][i]

            for s in strs[1:]:
                if s[i] != first_character:
                    return prefix
            prefix += first_character

        return prefix

```
